day on her bedroom wall. From that day forward, Jay Yoon developed an enthusiastic appreciation for art and paintings. She is
fascinated in how a few brushstrokes and color can bring joy and reverence to a person&rsquo;s life. And while she loves portraits
and framed artwork, she believes the BIGGER and BOLDER, the better!</p><p>Through Jay&rsquo;s extensive travels and experiences, she found people with similar passion to art. They would explain that
while they would have loved to adorn the walls of their homes and businesses with art, the cost and quality of murals had dissuaded
them. Many purchased canvas prints exported from China, resulting in an cheap and soulless copy and an &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; look.
What if there was a service that was inexpensive and interactive, providing convenient support and expert advice, resulting
in a art piece that is truly personal and endearing?</p><p>Jay&rsquo;s mission was now clear, but she needed the artist to help execute her vision. She needed a talented artist that
was devoted to their craft, patient and perceptive, someone who can lead others to realizing their individual vision and
creativity. No person met her needs more than her own art instructor and mentor, and after meeting for coffee and scones
in a quaint cafe on a lovely Saturday afternoon, a partnership was born!</p></section><section id="section-our-mission"><h1 class="section-title">About Us  </h1><h2 class="page-title">Our Mission</h2><p>We strive to create beautiful affordable art for homes, businesses and institutions.

We take great pride in providing an enjoyable and satisfying
experience for our customers. Here are the <strong>3 Basic Steps</strong> to having your creative vision realized:</p><h3>1. Contact Us and setup a FREE One Hour Consultation</h3><p>Contact us and we will set up a one hour free consultation. We&rsquo;ll visit and see the site (if you prefer, you may also visit our studio). We&rsquo;ll get to know you, see what 
you like and what you don&rsquo;t, and suggest the best strategy for your space. We then provide a hand-drawn sketch to help your
vision come alive. Finally, we&rsquo;ll provide a quote and move on to step two!</p><h3>2. Custom Design</h3><p>Working closely together with you, we develop and refine the design until you&rsquo;re 100% satisfied. We will correspond through email, texts,
phone calls or in-person meetings, whichever you prefer. Our goal is to finalize your vision with little intrusion to your daily routine
(we know you&rsquo;re busy, we work around YOUR schedule). No brush stroke is made until you love what you see!</p><h3>3. Your Mural Is Painted!</h3><p>Now, the fun begins! We can paint directly in your home, or at our studio on a canvas. Time will vary based on project, but before 
you know it, you&rsquo;ll have your very own masterpiece to marvel over! </p><p>For additional details or questions, please <a href="#/contact">contact us</a> anytime!</p></section><section id="section-faq"><h1 class="section-title">Our Services  </h1><h2 class="page-title">FAQ</h2><h3>Q. Who designs the mural, me or the artist?</h3><p class="answer">You have two options. The first option is to provide the artist input by sharing a painting or picture you&rsquo;ve made or 
seen elsewhere. The second option allows the artist to suggest a design that would work best in your space. Either way, 
the artist will provide sketches and help you envision the final piece in a process that is simple, fun and engaging.</p><h3>Q. How big can the mural be?</h3><p class="answer">BIG! We specialize in large-scale murals that cover the entire walls of your space. Let us know where you&rsquo;re thinking
of adding artwork and we&rsquo;ll let you know how big and beautiful it can be!</p><h3>Q. Do you only paint in private homes?</h3><p class="answer">Absolutely not! We paint in businesses and institutions, from medical offices to public school classrooms and administrative buildings.
Maybe you have a coffee shop in need of a makeover, or you work in a library that needs a pop of color. Wherever a drop of paint
can be applied, we can make it happen! </p><h3>Q. How long will my mural last?</h3><p class="answer">Many conditions can affect the mural quality and duration. Indoors/outdoors, the material its painted on, the paint itself, 
temperature, and other factors will determine the longevity of your mural. However, we&rsquo;ll take great care to ensure your 
mural lasts as long as possible. A good expectation is 15-20 years of pristine condition for an exterior mural, and a lifetime
of beauty for interior pieces.</p><h3>Q. What if I move out of my place in a few years? Is it still worth it to have a mural on my wall?</h3><p class="answer">We can paint on a canvas instead. There are many methods to insure your art can be transported to a new home. 
For more details and information, please schedule a free consultation with us.</p><h3>Q. What kind of paint do you use for your murals?</h3><p class="answer">However, if you prefer a certain look or essence that isn&rsquo;t easily captured with acrylics, we have the knowledge and experience 
to work in whichever medium appeals to you. </p><h3>Q. What if I&rsquo;m not satisfied with the work?</h3><p class="answer">J&amp;J Mural Art is proud to offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. We work with you at every stage of the process, addressing 
any concerns along the way. Our number one priority is your satisfaction, and with constant communication throughout the
creative process, you&rsquo;ll be ensured an unforgettable experience.</p></section><section id="section-murals"><h1 class="section-title">Our Work  </h1><ul class="work-tabbed-nav"><li
